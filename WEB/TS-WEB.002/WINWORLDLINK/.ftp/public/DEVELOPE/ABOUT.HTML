<h1 id="about-this-list">About this list</h1>
<p>If I have a specific development task the workflow for me looks like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Search through Google, GitHub, Unheap, npm, bower, jster and so on.</li>
<li>Compile a list of useful packages and tutorials for every one of them.</li>
<li>Select the best package for the task.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I created this list to not have to go through step #1 and #2 every time.</p>
